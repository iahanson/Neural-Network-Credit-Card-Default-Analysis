# Neural-Network-Credit-Card-Default-Analysis
An analysis of three types of neural networks to try to predict the likelihood of a customer default 

This repo houses a university project implementing three neural networks to try to predict credit card default.  The data set is from UCI Machine Learning repository and is based on 2005 Taiwan Credit Card Customers.

The Jupyter Notebook has basic implementation of a Multi-layer Perceptron model, an LSTM-MLP ensemble model and an Autoencoder.  Whilst none of the models performed to industry standards, the MLP model did outperfom the other two.
